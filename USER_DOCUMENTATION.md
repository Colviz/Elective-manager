# Elective Manager

## Introduction

Give your users an overview of the purpose and function of your project in a paragraph or two (at most). Because sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words, include screenshots when appropriate.

## Contributing

Refer CONTRIBUTING.md

## Installation

### Requirements

List anything your project requires in order to work as expected.

### Installation

Describe how to install your program. Be precise and give examples. Don't assume your users know how to clone from my github repo. Keep in mind that some of your users may be completely unskilled in system administration or software development.

### Configuration
