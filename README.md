## Introduction
This project named Elective Manager, is an open source project. It will be used to allot the Elective subjects to undergraduate as well as post-graduate students. These elective subjects are published by the departments and are allotted to students based on their priority of published subjects and CGPA. 

## Usage
There are 3 interfaces:
1. Admin Login
2. Department Login
3. Student Login

* Admin will open registration for Departmental Admin (will use an authorization key for registration, it'll be a Hash). This key will be generated automatically, Admin will have a separate interface to generate the key (dynamic creation of it). Admin is given the power to delete any user(student/department).

* Department Admin will post electives. When posting electives, Admin will post the following details - No. of seats, Elective code (as multiple electives), Name of professor taking the course and any additional information. The option to update elective details after posting is also given to the department Admin. The department Admin will get the final list of the students selected for each elective.

* After login, the students are provided with the option to prioritize published electives. Each student can see his/her status in each elective. students can also change or recover their passwords if forgotten.
